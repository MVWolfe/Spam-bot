# This code was found on a Youtube video
# I just thought I should make the code for everyone to be able to use
# You will want to use Pycharm for your IDE 
# This makes it easier to use the Pyautogui and time modules
# Make sure to also install the Pygame pip install before trying to 
# Start this bot
# You may need to try and find a better way to stop it once it gets going otherwise
# it will keep going forever, unless your're lucky and you can stop it in the IDE
# or you turn of your device

# sends about on message a second
#can only use on website and messages that don't have spam limits
